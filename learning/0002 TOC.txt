1. Installation of Python
    a. to check: py --version
    b. download VS code

2. Hello world
    a. print("Hello world")
    b. print("My age is", 21) => , comma joins string and integer or string, gives one space.
    c. print("My age is " + "21") => + , concatenate the two strings, but + won't give space.
    d. print("My age is" + 21) => this doesn't work.
    e. print("My age is" + "21") => + , concatenate the two strings.
    

3. Variables and Data types
    a. A Python variable is a reserved memory location (containers) to store values.
    b. Python has no command for declaring a variable.
    c. A variable is created the moment you first assign a value to it.
    d. If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
        x = str(3)    # x will be '3'
        y = int(3)    # y will be 3
        z = float(3)  # z will be 3.0
    e. You can get the data type of a variable with the type() function.
    f. Variable names are case-sensitive.

4. Strings in Python
    a. strings are just plain text.
    b. \n => to break line.
    c. \' => to print single quote (') in the sentence.
    d. print("Sakar"[0]) => give the 1st letter i.e. S
    e. .upper(), .lower(), .islower(), .isupper(), len(), ...
    f. print("Sakar".index("S")) => gives the index of S i.e. 0.
    g. print("Sakar is".replace("is", "has"))

5. Numbers in Python
    a. There are three numeric types in Python: int, float, complex
    b. Int, or integer, is a whole number, positive or negative, without decimals, of unlimited length.
    c. Float, or "floating point number" is a number, positive or negative, containing one or more decimals.
    d. Complex numbers are written with a "j" as the imaginary part
    e. +, -, /, * means the arithmetic.
    f. abs(), max(4, 2) => gives highest number, min(), round(), bin() => changes to binary.
    g. from math import * => math is a module that provides access to the mathematical Functions
    h. sqrt(). etc from math module

6. Getting user's input
    a. ask the user to input a text and we are going to save that text in the variable.
    b.  name = input("Input you Name: ")
        print(name)

7. Word Replacement Exercise
    a. in program directory: 0003wordReplacementExercise

8. Lists in Python
    a. Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
    b. Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.
    c. Lists are created using square brackets []
    d. List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
    e. List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
    f. Different datatypes can be added in the List.
    g. another way to declare:
        countries = list(('Nepal', 34, False))

9. List Methods in Python
      Method	    Description
    * append()  	Adds an element at the end of the list
    * clear()	    Removes all the elements from the list
    * copy()    	Returns a copy of the list
    * count()	    Returns the number of elements with the specified value
    * extend()  	Add the elements of a list (or any iterable), to the end of the current list
    * index()	    Returns the index of the first element with the specified value
    * insert()  	Adds an element at the specified position
    * pop()	        Removes the element at the specified position
    * remove()	    Removes the item with the specified value
    * reverse()	    Reverses the order of the list
    * sort()  	    Sorts the list
